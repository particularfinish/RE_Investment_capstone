# Real Estate Investment Prediction

The purpose of this data science project is to come up with a model that predicts whether an available house may meet the requirements of a 'typical' real estate investor.

There are many homes entering the market, and they sell extremely quickly. It's difficult for an investor to calculate capitalization rate and look at the neighborhood, when most houses list mid-week and are sold by Sunday. One of the investors I spoke with has an intuitive sense of why he purchases in the particular neighborhoods and at a particular price-point, but he has to drive around to get a 'feel' for the property; when purchasing in a new city, he has to fly there and look at it in person. This isn't efficient. Which characteristics of a property truly mean most to an investor? Can we use data to tell the investor the source of his intuitive 'feel'?

This project aims to build a predictive model which will suggest which of the currently available homes would meet an investor's criteria, using both the inventory of the individual investor I spoke with, and the inventory of one of the largest home-rental companies in the United States, and school demographic data for schools with enrollment based on geographical boundaries.
